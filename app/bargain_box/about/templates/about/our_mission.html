            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
                In an age where consumerism is growing and the environment is dying, our mission is clear: to encourage sustainable consumer practices.
                BargainBox aims to create a platform where items are given a second life, reducing waste and promoting a circular economy. 
                Together, we can make a difference — one transaction at a time.

                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
                    A 2015 study found that the production and use of household goods and services was responsible for 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
                    Not surprisingly, wealthy countries have the most per capita impact. This is because 45 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes solely from 
                    the production of the things we use and buy every day. While large oil companies like ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, 
                    we consumers are complicit. We demand the products and energy made from the fossil fuels they provide. One scientist found that 90 percent of fossil fuel companies’ emissions 
                    are a result of the products made from fossil fuels.

            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
                Thrifting and buying second-hand items have tangible benefits for the environment:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-start" style="font-size: 1.2rem; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Less clothing in landfills:</strong> Most clothes are made from synthetic materials, which take hundreds of years to decompose. Thrifting extends the life of clothes, reducing landfill waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Fewer wasted resources:</strong> Manufacturing clothes requires significant water resources. For example, one pair of jeans uses approximately 1,800 gallons of water in production. Thrifting helps decrease demand for new items, conserving resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced chemical pollution:</strong> Cotton production is pesticide-intensive, and textile manufacturing involves harmful dyes and crude oil by-products. Thrifting limits the environmental risks associated with these processes.</li>
            </ul>
