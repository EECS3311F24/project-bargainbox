**Arjun:**  
**1\.** What did you work on since the last standup?  
From the last meeting (sprint 2 planning meeting), I updated the backend/database so that all Posts could be Bookmarked. In addition, I implemented the functionality where only signed in users have the option to Bookmark Posts created by other users. This was accomplished by the creation of an “Add Bookmark” button associated with each Post that is only visible to signed in users who are not the owner of the Post or have not already Bookmarked that Post. Also, I completed the functionality that provides users the ability to view a collection of all of the Posts that they have Bookmarked within a separate tab called “Bookmarked Posts”. Furthermore, I have organized this layout so that Posts in this tab are seen in a grid view with two columns. I also provided access for users to the Detailed Post View page by clicking on the title of a Post within this “Bookmarked Posts” tab. In addition to this, I updated the CSS for each Post on the Homepage, when users are creating Posts, and also after a user searches for Posts by their title or location. 

**2\.** What do you commit to next?  
I commit to monitoring our project tracking on trello, completing the burndown.pdf document that needs to be submitted, as well as assisting any of my team members if they need any help with any of their programming tasks.
