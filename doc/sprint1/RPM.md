## Meeting Documentation:

## Date: Thursday, October 24 from 7:00 pm to 7:38 pm

## Key points:

* We discussed and confirmed the features that we would like to implement for sprint 1, sprint 2, and sprint 3 which are the following:  
  * The account system (login, logout, and register)  
  * The ability for users to add, view, and remove products from our website  
  * The ability for users to create a user profile  
  * The ability for users with a registered account to bookmark items posted from sellers so that they can view them later  
  * The ability for users to search for specific products in which they are interested in  
  * The ability for users to sort for specific products located in an area in which they live in

## Decisions Made:

* Focus on all attributes related to the account system as well as the user’s profile for sprint 1  
* Focus on providing the ability for our customers to add, view, and remove products on our website as well as the bookmark feature (where users can keep track of products that they are interested in that were posted from other members of our clientele) for sprint 2  
* Focus on the searching and sorting functionalities to improve the convenience for our users for sprint 3

## Meeting Notes

- Discussed the project timeline and major milestones.  
- Identified potential challenges and discussed solutions.  
- Agreed on communication methods, dividing tasks and meeting schedules.  
- Arjun mentioned that we should focus on the two most crucial features associated with a marketplace application in the earlier sprints, which are the account system and the ability for our clients to add products to our    platform.  
- Timothy also agreed with this and explained that this corresponds to the user stories mentioned in the product backlog.  
- Annie, Jasmine, and Micheal opened the product backlog document created in sprint 0 and found that these features correspond to the user stories: “As a registered user I would like to create an account” “As a registered user I would like to sign in and sign out of my  
  account” “As a registered user, I would like to create a new listing”  
- Everyone in the group then confirmed that these are the earlier release goals that we should focus on for the duration of the sprint.  
- Arjun and Timothy also suggested that the more convenience related functionalities (such as searching and sorting by location) should be focused on in sprint 3, as we should have a solid foundation for our website from    the earlier sprints. Annie, Jasmine, and Micheal also agreed with this.
