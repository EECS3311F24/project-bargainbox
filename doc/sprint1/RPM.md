## Meeting Notes
- Discussed the project timeline and major milestones.
- Identified potential challenges and discussed solutions.
- Agreed on communication methods, dividing tasks and meeting schedules.

- Timothy also agreed with this and explained that this corresponds to the user stories mentioned in the product backlog.
- Annie, Jasmine, and Michael opened the product backlog document created in sprint 0 and found that these features correspond to the user stories: 
“As a registered user I would like to create an account”, 
“As a registered user I would like to sign in and sign out of my  
 account”
“As a registered user, I would like to create a new listing”
- Everyone in the group then confirmed that these are the release goals that we should focus on for the duration of the sprint.
