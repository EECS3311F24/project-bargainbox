# Sprint 1 Planning Document - Bargain Box
**Participants:** Arjun, Timothy, Annie, Michael, Jasmine

## Sprint Goal
The objective of Sprint 1 is to develop a fully functional Account System that includes:
1. A registration feature to create new accounts.
2. A login and logout system for account access.
3. A user profile that registered users can view and update.

## Sprint Spikes (Research/Learning Tasks)
To achieve our sprint goal, we need to research and learn the following:

1. How to connect our individual tasks and components together (will probably have to look at some tutorials)
For example, how to link the Sign in page to the Homepage as well as connecting the user profile page to users who are signed in only

2. Learning how to test and modify the database to ensure that the login and logout systems work correctly
For example, the username and password must be an exact match to an existing set of username and password recorded within the database

3. Learning to make sure that the registration system correctly checks if a new account cannot be made due to either a username already existing, and invalid email address, or an invalid password
For example, two customers both cannot have “John Smith” as their username

4. Learning how to add a user profile and update it for each individual client that is registered to our website.
For example, only signed in users will be able to update the user profile page.

## User Stories to be Completed
- **User Story 1:** "As a user, I would like to create an account so that I can access personalized features."
- **User Story 2:** "As a registered user, I would like to sign in and sign out of my account to secure my personal information."
- **User Story 3:** "As a registered user, I would like to view my profile to see my account details."
- **User Story 4:** "As a registered user, I would like to edit my profile to keep my information up to date."

## Participation and Decisions
- Each participant was consulted about their responsibilities and shared input on how tasks are divided.
- Consensus was reached on the sprint goal and task allocation, ensuring balanced workload distribution.

---

## Risk and Dependency Assessment
1. **Dependency Risks:** Some tasks, like User Profile integration, are dependent on the successful completion of account registration and login/logout features.
2. **Mitigation Plans:** 
   - Team members will meet twice during the sprint to address any issues with integration.
   - Code reviews will be conducted after completion of each component to check for conflicts early.

---

## Key Decisions
- Prioritize database testing and user authentication early in the sprint to prevent bottlenecks.
- Set up a shared document for tracking task progress and any necessary group check-ins.

## Conclusion
With a clear sprint goal, detailed task breakdown, and established communication strategies, the team is well-prepared to complete the Account System functionality in Sprint 1.
