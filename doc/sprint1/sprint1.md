## Sprint Goal
The objective of Sprint 1 is to develop a fully functional Account System that includes:
1. A registration feature to create new accounts.
2. A login and logout system for account access.
3. A user profile that registered users can view and update.

## Sprint Spikes (Research/Learning Tasks)
To achieve our sprint goal, we need to research and learn the following:

1. **Connecting Individual Components:**
   - Learn how to link the Sign-in page to the Homepage and ensure the user profile page is accessible only to signed-in users.
   - Explore tutorials on integrating different components in a Django-based application.

2. **Database Testing and Modifications:**
   - Research how to test and manage database connections to ensure login/logout functionality works correctly.
   - Ensure username and password validation matches the entries in the database.

3. **Registration System Validations:**
   - Learn how to enforce unique username validation, valid email format checks, and strong password requirements.
   - Prevent duplicate account creation with the same username.

4. **User Profile Management:**
   - Understand how to create, display, and update user profiles.
   - Ensure only authenticated users can update their profiles.

## User Stories to be Completed
- **User Story 1:** "As a user, I would like to create an account so that I can access personalized features."
- **User Story 2:** "As a registered user, I would like to sign in and sign out of my account to secure my personal information."
- **User Story 3:** "As a registered user, I would like to view my profile to see my account details."
- **User Story 4:** "As a registered user, I would like to edit my profile to keep my information up to date."

## Risk and Dependency Assessment
1. **Dependency Risks:** Some tasks, like User Profile integration, are dependent on the successful completion of account registration and login/logout features.
2. **Mitigation Plans:** 
   - Team members will meet twice during the sprint to address any issues with integration.
   - Code reviews will be conducted after completion of each component to check for conflicts early.

---

## Key Decisions
- Prioritize database testing and user authentication early in the sprint to prevent bottlenecks.
- Set up a shared document for tracking task progress and any necessary group check-ins.
