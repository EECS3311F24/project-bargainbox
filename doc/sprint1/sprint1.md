**Sprint Planning Meeting**

**Date:** Tuesday, October 29 from 7:05 pm to 7:40 pm

**Sprint Goal:** The objective is to complete the Account System as well as to create a user profile for each user with an account.

**Spikes (The research/Learning Tasks Required For our Group)**

* How to connect our individual tasks and components together (will probably have to look at some tutorials)  
  * For example, how to link the sign in page to the homepage as well as connecting the user profile page to users who are signed in only  
* Learning how to test and modify the database to ensure that the login and logout systems work correctly  
  * For example, the username and password must be an exact match to an existing set of username and password recorded within the database  
* Learning to make sure that the registration system correctly checks if a new account cannot be made due to either a username already existing, and invalid email address, or an invalid password  
  * For example, two customers both cannot have “John Smith” as their username  
* Learning how to add a user profile and update it for each individual client that is registered to our website.  
  * For example, only signed in users will be able to update the user profile page.

**User Stories to be Completed:**

* “As a registered user I would like to create an account”  
* “As a registered user I would like to sign in and sign out of my account”  
* “As a registered user I would like to view my profile”
