**Team organization (roles)-**

Our team organized all roles clearly and precisely while keeping each otherâ€™s strengths and weaknesses in mind.
1. *Front-end*: With previous knowledge of User experience and personas, Jasmin and Annie took over the front-end part. 
2. *Back-end*: With hands-on practice, Arjun, Timothy and Michael contributed towards the development of Bargain Box.
3. *Documentation*: Each member was responsible for documenting the part of work that they were in-charge of. 
4. *Quality assurance*: Contribution by all team members
For the data to be correct and precise, each document was proof-read by some other member than the team member who prepared it for correctness and quality assurance. 


**Decision making-**

Our team used a consensus-based decision-making procedure. During meetings, every team member was given equal opportunity to bring their views and opinions to the table. In order for ease of access, all of the decisions were documented on our Discord server which made it easier to follow-up and make any kind of required changes.
