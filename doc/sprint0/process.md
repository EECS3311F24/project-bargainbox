**Team organization (roles)**

Our team organized all roles clearly and precisely while keeping each otherâ€™s strengths and weaknesses in mind.

For the data to be correct and precise, each document was proof-read by some other member than the team member who prepared it for correctness and quality assurance. 

**Decision making**

Our team used a consensus-based decision-making procedure. During meetings, every team member was given equal opportunity to bring their views and opinions to the table. 

**Prioritizing user stories**

**2. Technical feasability:**

**Meetings**
Our team aimed meeting on Thursdays and Tuesdays after class time. 

-> **Thursday:** Mostly focused on major updates and planning for next big-steps.

-> **Tuesday:** It was treated as a check-in meeting and also to see if every team member was comfortable with completing the assigned tasks.
