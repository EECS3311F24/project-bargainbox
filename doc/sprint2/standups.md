**Standup meeting #1**
\[Sunday, November 10, 2024 @ 2:00pm\] \- Sprint 2, Standup 1

**Michael:**  
**1\.** What did you work on since the last standup?  
Since the sprint planning meeting, I have implemented the delete user profile feature. I also discussed roles and responsibilities with Jasmin regarding the view my posts feature that we will be jointly implementing.

**2\.** What do you commit to next?  
Next, I commit to configuring the routes, Django app, home page navigation link, and skeleton page for the view my posts feature. This is the highest priority as it is currently blocking Jasmin. After this is completed, I commit to implementing the add/view/update profile picture feature.

**3\.** When do you think you’ll be done?  
At this time, I intend to unblock Jasmin by tonight (Sunday, November 10, 2024). Further, I intend to finish implementing the add/view/update profile picture feature by Monday, November 11th, 2024.

**4\.** Do you have any blockers?  
At this time, I have no blockers.

**Arjun:**  
**1\.** What did you work on since the last standup?  
From the last meeting (sprint 2 planning meeting), I not only completed the backend setup (database) for creating posts, but also provided all users the ability to view all posts on the homepage based on the time they were posted (most recent posts appear at the top of the homepage). In addition to this, I have fully implemented the frontend for the create post feature, which is specific to “signed in users” who can create posts by entering values for the title, content/description, location, quantity, and price (with the additional option of including a picture). I’ve also made sure that these posts will be displayed on the homepage as well. Moreover, an HTML link to the Post Title was added so that the Detailed Post View feature could be implemented. Additionally, I created some of the cards on Trello for some of the features we wish to implement in sprint 2.

**2\.** What do you commit to next?  
I commit to fully implementing the functionality for all users to search for specific posts based on their title or location. More specifically, I plan to include a search bar that appears on the homepage which uses a query to filter and display specific posts based on the text that the user enters. I also intend on updating the CSS so that posts on the homepage look cleaner. 

**3\.** When do you think you’ll be done?  
I believe that I will be able to complete this next commitment (the search for posts by title or location functionality as well as updating the CSS for posts on the homepage) by tomorrow (Monday, November 11, 2024).

**4\.** Do you have any blockers?  
I currently do not have any blockers.

**Annie:**  
**1\.** What did you work on since the last standup?  
Since the sprint planning meeting, I have begun working on implementing the edit post feature.

**2\.** What do you commit to next?  
Next, after the edit post feature is implemented, I commit to implementing the delete post feature.

**3\.** When do you think you’ll be done?  
At this time, I intend to finish implementing the edit post feature by Tuesday, November 12, 2024. I will implement the delete post feature shortly after I implement the edit post feature.

**4\.** Do you have any blockers?  
I was previously blocked from doing any work since the edit and delete post features rely on the create post feature being implemented first. Now, since Arjun has completed the create post feature, I am no longer blocked.

**Jasmin:**  
**1\.** What did you work on since the last standup?  
Since the sprint planning meeting, I discussed with Michael the division of work for the view my posts feature. He will be configuring the routes, Django app, home page navigation link, and skeleton page. I will be implementing the actual contents of the page.

**2\.** What do you commit to next?  
Once I finish implementing the view my posts feature, I commit to applying some styles on the home page and the my posts page.

**3\.** When do you think you’ll be done?  
At this time, I intend to finish implementing the view my posts feature by Tuesday, November 12, 2024. All going well, after the view my posts feature is implemented, I intend to move on to applying some styles on the home page and the my posts page. I hope to complete the styling by Thursday, November 14, 2024.

**4\.** Do you have any blockers?  
I cannot begin my part until Michael implements the routes, Django app, home page navigation link, and skeleton page. Thus, I am currently blocked.

**Quoc Trong:**  
**1\.** What did you work on since the last standup?  
Since the sprint planning meeting, I have done some general housekeeping. In particular, I updated .gitignore to ignore __pycache__ directories, and I moved the Post database model to a new app called post. Beyond housekeeping tasks, I also implemented the view post in detail feature.

**2\.** What do you commit to next?  
I will commit to integration testing of all the features once complete.

**3\.** When do you think you’ll be done?  
Integration testing should take place once all features are implemented. It will take up to one day.

**4\.** Do you have any blockers?  
I cannot begin integration testing until all features are implemented. Thus, I am blocked.
