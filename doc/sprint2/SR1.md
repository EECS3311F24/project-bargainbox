# SR1 Meeting Notes for Bargain Box Project

## Participants
- Annie Jhamb
- Arjun Grewal
- Jasmin Slootweg
- Michael Favret
- Quoc Trong Dao

### To-Do
- Update `PB.md` and place it in `doc/sprint2`

## Unfinished Tasks
Of the four user stories that were planned for sprint 1, two of them were fully completed, and two of them were only partially completed. As such, the remaining work for the partially completed user stories has been deferred to sprint 2. The partially completed user stories are as follow:

**As a registered user, I would like to view my profile.**  
* In sprint 1, we implemented the ability for the signed in user to view their username and email address.  
* In sprint 2, we must complete this user story by allowing the signed in user to view their profile picture and account creation date. Further, we need to apply styles to this feature.  

**As a registered user, I would like to delete or edit my profile.**  
* In sprint 1, we implemented the ability for the signed in user to edit their username and email address.  
* In sprint 2, we must complete this user story by allowing the signed in user to edit their profile picture and permanently delete their profile. Further, we need to apply styles to this feature.  

## Practices to Continue
- **Discord Communication**: Continue using Discord for quick updates and team discussions.
- **One-on-One Support Calls**: Maintain the practice of offering individual help sessions for more complex issues.

## New Practices to Add
- **Early Start on Tasks**: Begin tasks earlier in each sprint to allow more time for review and troubleshooting.
- **Prioritize Trello Setup**: Set up Trello and organize tasks at the beginning of each sprint for better tracking.
- **Push Notifications**: Notify teammates on Discord before pushing changes to the `main` branch to prevent conflicts.

## Harmful Practices to Avoid
- **Updated Main Branch**: Always pull the latest changes from `main` before starting new edits to avoid merge conflicts.

## Best Experiences
- **Frequent Meetings and Discussions**: Regular team sync-ups improved project flow and helped resolve blockers.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Team members actively supported each other through challenges.
- **Learning New Frameworks**: Working with Django and new tools has been a rewarding learning experience.

## Worst Experiences
- **Delayed Start**: Starting tasks earlier could have helped reduce time pressure later in the sprint.
- **Improving Task and Time Management**: More effective task prioritization and scheduling could help the team stay on track.
